Scenario:

You have
been asked to set up a WordPress blog for your company per their defined
specifications.



During
business hours (9AM-6PM), the blogging team would like to use their own
development copy of the WordPress instance, so that any work they are doing
doesnâ€™t impact the live copy.



You are required to create a plan
to achieve these goals using Amazon CloudFormation, creating a new AMI and Auto
Scaling.
